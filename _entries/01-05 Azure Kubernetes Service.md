### Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) manages your hosted Kubernetes environment, making it quick and easy to deploy and manage containerized applications without container orchestration expertise. It also eliminates the burden of ongoing operations and maintenance by provisioning, upgrading, and scaling resources on demand, without taking your applications offline.

#### Why AKS?

- Accelerate containerised application development
-	Manage Kubernetes with ease
-	Build on an enterprise-grade, more secure foundation
-	Run any workload in the cloud, at the edge or as a hybrid
- Flexible, hence use only resources required
- Supports agile project management
