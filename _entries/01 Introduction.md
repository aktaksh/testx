Welcome to the Biqmind Azure Kubernetes Workshop!
This workshop has been modified from [The Azure Kubernetes Workshop](https://aksworkshop.io/) for easier and thorough understanding of the concepts of AKS, encouraging participants to investigate it further on their own and demonstrating the practice of actual methods. It is a hands-on opportunity to learn new processes and procedures in a safe environment.

In this lab, you'll go through tasks that will help you master the basic and more advanced topics required to deploy a multi-container application to Kubernetes on [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/).
