To help participants navigate the flow of the workshop, we have divided learning into the following sections.

### Getting Started Tasks

In the **Getting Started with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** section, we will be setting up a Kubernetes cluster, deploying the application containers from Azure Container Registry (ACR) and understand the application components.

### Dev Tasks

Once you're done with the Core tasks, next would be to include some **Dev Tasks**. This involves configuring manifest files in YAML format with details of database and repository, deploying an application into AKS and exposing it for external connections.

### Operations Tasks

After you have completed the Dev tasks, you move on to the **Operations Tasks** to learn how to operate and maintain the AKS cluster. This involves performing rolling updates and rollbacks, monitoring, scaling and security.

### DevOps Tasks

**DevOps Tasks** will integrate both the Dev and Operations tasks by setting up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipeline for your application using Azure DevOps.

### Advanced Tasks

If youâ€™re up to it, use the **Advanced Tasks** to explore storing secrets in the Azure Key Vault, installing tools using Helm 3.0 on Azure and scaling MongoDB using a StatefulSet.
