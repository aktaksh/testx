### Workshop Outcomes & Business Benefits

Kubernetes has emerged as the leading container-orchestration platform for automating application deployment, scaling, and management. Enterprise users struggle with immature supporting tools, challenging security configuration, a steep learning curve and complicated infrastructure.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed service offering on Azure by Microsoft. With AKS, you have a robust, hosted Kubernetes environment to easily deploy and manage your containerized applications without the need for deep container orchestration expertise.

This workshop has been designed to help you understand how the Microsoft Azure platform can be leveraged to meet critical business objectives with the use of containers and Kubernetes container orchestration.

### Approach

This 2-day workshop will introduce how containers are deployed and managed on AKS and explore working on the platform. Participants will gain theoretical knowledge and benefit from hands-on experience in Kubernetes design, deployment and management on Azure.

Some of the things youâ€™ll be going through:

- Kubernetes deployments, services and ingress
- Perform rolling updates and rollback a deployment
- Azure Monitor for Containers, Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and the Cluster Autoscaler
- Build CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps and Azure Container Registry
- Use Azure Key Vault for secrets
